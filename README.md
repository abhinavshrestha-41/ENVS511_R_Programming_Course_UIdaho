## About ENVS 511 Course:
Welcome to my ENVS 511 Final Project Repo! **ENVS 511** is a graduate level R-programming course taught by [Dr Jan U.H. Eitel](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/faculty/eitel-j) from the [College of Natural Resources](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr) at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). The course focuses on the use of statistical data manipulation, visualization, and analysis in R from environmental science related data. 

## About the Final Project Repo:
The final project repo contains: 

* Point cloud datasets of healthy, damaged, and dead tree sets. Datasets are in .txt format. 
* R-script of the point cloud data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization. 
* [R-markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document (with the R-script in code chunks) used to create the Rpubs webpage that summerizes the data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization conducted in R as a part of the final project.
