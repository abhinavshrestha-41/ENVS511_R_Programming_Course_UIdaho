# ENVS 511 (R-programming Course) Repo

## About ENVS 511 Course @UIdaho:
Welcome to my ENVS 511 Course Repo! **ENVS 511** is a graduate level R-programming course taught by [Dr Jan U.H. Eitel](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/faculty/eitel-j) from the [College of Natural Resources](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr) at the [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). The course focuses on the use of statistical data manipulation, visualization, and analysis in R from environmental science related data. 

## About the course repo:

This repo contains projects developed during the semester of the R-programming course @UIdaho. As such, the projects are limited in scope and scale due to the limited time frame of the semester. This repo contains two sub-directories with two main projects for the course:

* The **'FinalProject'** sub-directory contains all the relevant files and code for the final project submitted for the course. Please review the README.md file present in the sub-directory for more information and the URL to the RPubs HTML document for the final project.

* The **'RShinyApp'** sub-directory contains all the relavant files and code for the R Shiny App developed during the R-programming course. Please review the README.md file present in the sub-directory for more information and the URL to the R Shiny App.
